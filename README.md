# PASSWORD_BASED_DOOR_LOCK_SYSTEM_8051_microcontroller
The purpose of our project is to build a password-based door lock system using an 8051 microcontroller. Password base lock systems are very popular nowadays because of their simple yet very effective applications. Password-based systems are replacing a traditional key and lock-based system and password-based lock systems are also more secure and user friendly than traditional Key-based systems.
